# Case dimensions
PCB/plate height
Plate to bottom of keycap: 6.6mm
Switch housing: 5mm
(minus top plate width of 1.5mm = 3.5 of space)
Pins/Solder: 3.3mm
(minus pcb/wire width of 1.5mm = 1.8mm under the pcb if there is one)
Extra space for Controller/socket (if bigger than 1.8mm): 0

Finding the number of intermediate layers:
1. Start with number from above: 8.3mm 
2. Subtract the width of the switch plate (1.5 allows switches to click in)
-- For 1.5mm plate: 6.8mm remaining
-- For 3mm plate: 5.3mm remaining
3. Divide remaining by width of intermediates
-- For 1.5mm intermediates: 5 = 7.5mm (0.7mm space left)
-- For 3mm intermediates: 2 = 6mm (0.7mm space left)
